# Installation {#installation}

### CDN

Recommended: [https://unpkg.com/vue-ls](https://unpkg.com/vue-ls), which will reflect the latest version as soon as it is published to npm. You can also browse the source of the npm package at [https://unpkg.com/vue-ls/](https://unpkg.com/vue-ls/)

Also available on [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue-ls@latest) or [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/vue-ls), but these two services take some time to sync so the latest release may not be available yet.

### NPM

`npm install vue-ls --save`

### Yarn

`yarn add vue-ls`

### Bower

`bower install vue-ls --save`
